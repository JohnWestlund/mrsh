Requires:
	Working compiler, libc, kernel, and munge.

Security:
        See munge for more details.

Installation:
	Do "./configure --help" and decide what options you want. The
	defaults should be suitable for most Linux systems. Then run
	the configure script.

	Do "make" to compile.
	Then (as root) do "make install".

        Update xinetd files in /etc/xinetd.d/ appropriately.

        Add pam configuration for mrshd and mrlogind appropriately.

	Save a backup copy of any mission-critical program in case the
	new one doesn't work, and so forth. We warned you.

Bugs:
	Please make sure the header files in /usr/include match the
	libc version installed in /lib and /usr/lib. If you have weird
	problems this is the most likely culprit.
