mrcp:
	- should call mrsh instead of using root
	- pukes on files in /proc
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

mrlogin: 
	- should use sigaction
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

mrsh:
	- should try mrexec if mcmd doesn't work
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

mrexecd:
	- apparently the anti-portscanning fix causes mrexecd to not
          work with some or all mrexec clients.
